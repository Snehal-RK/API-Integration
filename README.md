*Description* - 

This project represents the successful completion of API Integration, focusing on the integration of a public API to fetch and display data on a dynamic web page. The project leverages a combination of JSP (Java Server Pages) for server side  processing, CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) for styling and layout and JavaScript for client-side interactivity and API communication.

Technical Implementation -

- JSP - The core of the web page is built using JSP, allowing for dynamic content generation and server-side logic. JSP is used to define the overall structure of the page, including the Layout, placeholders for data and any necessary server side calculations.

- CSS - CSS is employed to enhance the visual presentation of the web page, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. CSS is used to define styles for various elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing and layout ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.

- JavaScript - JavaScript plays a crucial role in enabling client-side interactivity and handling the API integration. JavaScript is used to:
    - Make an asynchronous request to the Unsplash API.
 
    - Parse the received JSON response to extract the relevant data, such as image URLs, desctiptions etc.
 
    - Dynamically update the web page with the fetched data, populating the placeholders with the corresponding images and details.

API Integration -

The project utilizes the Unsplash API to fetch a collection of images based on specific criteria. The API request i smade using JavaScript's fetch API, which allows for asynchronous communication with the server. The response from API is in JSON format, which is then parsed and processed to extract the required information.

Responsiveness -

The web page is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. CSS styles based on viewport width, ensuring optimal viewing desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

Deliverables -

The final deliverable is a fully functional web page that :

- Fetches and displays images from the unsplash API.

- Presents the images in a visually appealing and organized manner.

- Maintains a clean and well-structured codebase.

- Is responsive and accessible accross various devices.

The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Web Development Fundamentals, including server side scripting with JSP, client-side interactivity with JavaScript and responsive design principles. The successful integration of the UnSplash API showcases the ability to work with external APIs and leverage their data to create dynamic and engaging web experiences.
